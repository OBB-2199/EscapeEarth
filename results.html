        The previously unknown exoplanets candidates have star ids: 160585813, 190885165, & 356632361.

      <p>
      Star with id 28230919 is an interesting known system with 4 planets, 2 of which are confirmed. Our method has detected the first confirmed exoplanet from this system.
      For the remaining stars, all had known single exoplanet candidates. Although these were previously known detections, they serve as confirmation that our method is working. We recovered the same orbital periods and radii for all the exoplanet candidates except one. For star id 27915909 we calculate a smaller estimated planet radius than other studies, so this could be due to a discrepancy in methods, data quality or an indication of multiple exoplanets.
      Further investigation will be required to fully understand and confirm all of these potential exosolar systems.
